# Genome preparation

Bismark needs to prepare the bisulfite index for the genome.

* In the current pipeline, user can provide the \`genome.fasta\` and the pipeline can index it.
* Optinally, user can provide the index files directly, and the pipeline will use it without indexing the genome again.
